        <p style="font-size:20px;"> Our mission at COVAID is all about talking COVID-19. It has impacted every single one of us whether at work, home or play. Physical distancing has changed the way we approach security and has challenged us to find solutions outside of the norm, including technology-based security solutions. What hasn't changed is our commitment to providing the same high level of service to our customers. In fact, the changes we have seen right across the country have allowed us to collaborate and innovate within our own team and with our clients, in more meaningful ways than we would have expected. We are all truly committed to doing what’s needed to keep our clients, our teams and our communities safe. Throughout all of this, we have asked just one question… “How can we help?” </p>
